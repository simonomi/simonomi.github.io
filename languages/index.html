			<p>this is where i record my progress in learning various (non-programming) languages. the intention is to give other people an estimated level of my proficiency, as well as concrete information regarding what words i know. however, just because a term is listed doesn't necessarily mean that i <em>do</em> know it, just that i <em>should</em> know it.</p>
			<p>the lists of terms are created using <a href="https://github.com/simonomi/languages/blob/main/database_generator.py">a script</a> that indexes the <a href="https://obsidian.md">obsidian</a> vaults i use (along with the <a href="https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition">spaced repetition plugin</a>) to study languages. i only run this script occasionally, so terms are typically added in large groups at a time. the newest terms are highlighted in <span class="new">green</span>.</p>
